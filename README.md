# Melanoma Detection
Melanoma, also known as malignant melanoma, is a type of cancer that develops from the pigment-containing cells known as melanocytes. Melanomas typically occur in the skin, but may rarely occur in the mouth, intestines, or eye. In women, they most commonly occur on the legs, while in men they are most common on the back. Sometimes they develop from a mole with concerning changes including an increase in size, irregular edges, change in color, itchiness, or skin breakdown.

Melanoma is the most dangerous type of skin cancer. Globally, in 2012, it newly occurred in 232,000 people. In 2015 there were 3.1 million with active disease which resulted in 59,800 deaths.

If Melanoma can be diagnosed at very early stage, it can be cured. The problem is only few experts can recognise that it is malanoma not any simple mole. But experts are not present everywhere, that's why it is difficult to detect the Malanoma at early stage. 

In this Project we will be solving this problem with the help of computer Vision and Machine Learning. We will be training our model with the dataset of malanoma positive and negative images. Then we will be predicting our results based on the Machine learning model. 

I request you to contribute in this project and became a part is great cause. 

At the begining I will be using Knn in OpenCV python for this project, we can move it on CNN for better results.

Thank you for your precious time.
